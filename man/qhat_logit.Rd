\title{Estimate marginal and joint distribution of lists j and k using logistic regression.}
\usage{
qhat_logit(List.train, List.test, K = 2, j = 1, k = 2, margin = 0.005, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{List.train}{The training data matrix used to estimate the distibution functions.}

\item{List.test}{The data matrix on which the estimator function is applied.}

\item{K}{The number of lists in the data.}

\item{j}{The first list that is conditionally independent.}

\item{k}{The second list that is conditionally independent.}

\item{margin}{The minimum value the estimates can attain to bound them away from zero.}

\item{...}{Any extra arguments passed into the function.}
}
\value{
A list of the marginal and joint distribution probabilities q_1, q_2 and q_12.
